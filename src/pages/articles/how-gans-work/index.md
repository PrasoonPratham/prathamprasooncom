**"Generative Adversarial Networks" (or GANs for short)** is a fascinating approach for training neural networks.

It sounds really complicated but it isn't. 

Let's talk about it.

> Pre-requisites to follow along: None.

### A GAN has 2 parts: A generator and a discriminator.

- The generator generates images(in this case) and the discriminator tries to identify if the images made by the generator are real or fake. 

- Essentially putting 2 neural networks in a fight against each other. 

### Let's understand it better through this example:

- We have a generator that generates images of a 10 dollar bill.

Here are some of the rules:
- The discriminator tries to determine if it is fake or not.

- For every image that it recognizes correctly whether it's fake or real, it receives a point.

- A point is deducted for every mistake it makes.

#### The first few images which are generated by the generator are very obviously fake

The discriminator easily detects the fake photos generated by the generator.

Discriminator's Score: 1

#### Now the generator makes an image that is slightly "less fake" than the previous ones. 

The discriminator still correctly detects that it is a fake but it's getting tougher every time.

Discriminator's Score: 2

#### Now, the generator has started making images that are really * really * close to real images. 

(Notice that there is a small brown box on the left corner in the generated image as a defect)

The discriminator is fooled and it loses a point. ðŸ˜¢

Discriminator's Score: 1

The discriminator realizes that it has made a mistake and learns from it. This process continues and the discriminator learns and improves after every iteration.

GANs can also be applied in NLP (Natural Language Processing).

> In fact, that is how GPT-3, one of the world's largest neural networks, was trained on text data.
